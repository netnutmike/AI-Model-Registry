# Trivy ignore file for known false positives or accepted risks

# Example: Ignore specific CVE that has been assessed as low risk
# CVE-2021-44228

# Ignore low severity vulnerabilities in development dependencies
# These should be reviewed periodically but don't block builds

# Node.js base image vulnerabilities that are patched in newer versions
# Update base images regularly to address these

# Development-only dependencies with known issues
# These don't affect production builds but may show up in scans
