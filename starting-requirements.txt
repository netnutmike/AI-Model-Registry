Awesome project. Here’s a complete, implementation-ready requirements set for an **AI Model Repository, Catalog & Registry with Built-in Governance**. It’s organized for product, engineering, security, and risk teams to execute against.

---

# 1) Objectives & Scope

* **Single Source of Truth:** Central registry for models (classical ML + LLMs/agents) and all associated artifacts.
* **Governance by Design:** Required controls (risk, privacy, safety, compliance) embedded into the lifecycle, not bolted on.
* **Interop First:** Open APIs and adapters for popular ML stacks (MLflow, Hugging Face, Vertex, SageMaker, Databricks, Kubernetes).
* **Auditability:** Immutable lineage, decisions, and approvals designed for audit (SOX/SOC2, ISO/IEC 42001, NIST AI RMF, GDPR/CCPA).
* **Automation:** CI/CD gates, policy engine, and auto-generated documentation (Model Cards, SBOMs, Eval Reports).

Out of scope (initially): on-prem training platform, GPU scheduling, and experiment tracking UI (integrate instead).

---

# 2) Personas

* **Model Owner / ML Engineer:** publishes, versions, and deploys models.
* **Data Scientist / Prompt Engineer:** experiments and prepares releases.
* **Product Owner:** requests models, accepts risk, tracks use cases.
* **Model Risk & Compliance (MRC):** reviews risks, controls, and approvals.
* **Security Architect:** sets and enforces policies, keys, and secrets.
* **SRE / MLOps:** runs infra, rollouts, and observability.
* **Auditor:** reads immutable logs and evidence.

---

# 3) Core User Stories (high level)

1. As a Model Owner, I can register a model with versioned artifacts, metadata, lineage, and a deployment target.
2. As MRC, I can require and record bias/safety/effectiveness evaluations before promotion.
3. As Security, I can enforce policy gates (PII, license, export controls, red-team results) at publish time.
4. As SRE, I can roll back a bad model version safely with provenance captured.
5. As an Auditor, I can reconstruct who approved what, when, with evidence and immutable hashes.

---

# 4) Functional Requirements

## 4.1 Catalog & Registry

* **Model Identity:** `group/name`, semantic **Versioning** (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) + build metadata.
* **Artifacts:** binaries, weights, tokenizer, adapters/LoRA, prompts, config, Docker images; large artifact storage with checksums.
* **Lineage:** link to datasets, feature sets, code commit, data snapshot, training run ID, environment, base model (for LLM fine-tunes), and upstream licenses.
* **Tags & Taxonomy:** business domain, use case, sensitivity, data domains, geography, customer impact.
* **Search & Discovery:** full-text search, filters (owner, status, tags, framework, license), “similar models.”
* **Model Cards:** auto-generated from metadata + human annotations; include intended use, limitations, safety notes, evals, and known risks.
* **SBOM/BOM:** supply-chain bill of materials for model + container; dependency and license scan results stored.

## 4.2 Metadata Schema (minimum fields)

* `identity`: id, name, version, owners, contact
* `provenance`: repo URL, commit SHA, training job id, trainer image digest
* `artifacts`: URIs + sha256 for weights, tokenizer, container image
* `data`: dataset ids + versions, PII categories, data residency, retention
* `evals`: task metrics, adversarial tests, bias/fairness, robustness, jailbreak/prompt-injection rates, toxicity/PII leakage, hallucination rate (for LLMs), uncertainty
* `risk`: model risk tier, business impact, failure modes, mitigations, red-team summary
* `legal`: licenses, export controls, third-party terms, usage restrictions
* `security`: encryption class, signing status, key ids, vuln scans, SBOM id
* `governance`: approvals (who/role/time), exceptions, expiry/recert date
* `deployment`: target(s), canary %/shadowing, runtime policies, rollback plan
* `monitoring`: SLOs, drift detectors, data quality checks, telemetry schema

*(Provide JSON example in §10)*

## 4.3 Lifecycle Workflows

* **Register → Validate → Evaluate → Risk Review → Approve → Promote → Deploy → Monitor → Recertify/Retire.**
* **State Machine:** Draft, Submitted, Changes Requested, Approved-for-Staging, Staging, Approved-for-Prod, Production, Deprecated, Retired.
* **Gates (blocking):** metadata completeness, license scan clean, SBOM present, evals meet thresholds, bias/safety min scores, MRC approval for risk tier≥Medium, security sign-off for external data/PII, data residency match.
* **Exceptions:** tracked with rationale, time-boxed, approver role, and compensating controls.

## 4.4 Evaluations & Testing

* **Eval Registry:** store datasets, prompts, fixtures, and harness configs (e.g., Eleuther/HELM-style, internal golden sets).
* **Automatic Scoring:** task metrics (AUC, F1), LLM metrics (groundedness, hallucination, refusal correctness), robustness (noise, truncation), jailbreak/prompt-injection resistance, bias/fairness (group metrics), safety/tos compliance.
* **Release Thresholds:** per-use-case policies; e.g., “hallucination≤3%, PII leakage=0.”
* **Red-Team Runs:** capture scripts, findings, fix-tracking, and re-tests.

## 4.5 Policy Engine

* **Declarative Policies:** Rego/CEL/YAML rules evaluating metadata + results at key events (register, promote, deploy).
* **Policy Packs:** data governance, privacy, safety, licensing, export, geo controls, business criticality.
* **Outcome:** pass/block/warn; emit structured reasons; machine-readable for CI.

## 4.6 Runtime Governance & Monitoring

* **Runtime Registry:** maps model version → runtime endpoints (batch/online) with environment, region, and config.
* **Observability:** request/response logging (privacy-safe), model latency, throughput, error, quality KPIs; LLM telemetry (refusal correctness, jailbreak attempts, safety filter hits).
* **Data & Concept Drift:** PSI/KS tests, feature drift, embedding drift; alerting thresholds.
* **Safety Guardrails:** content filters, PII scrubbing, prompt templates, output moderation; configurable per deployment.
* **Rollback & Kill-Switch:** one-click to prior good version; circuit breakers.
* **Recertification:** auto-open tasks on threshold breaches or recert date.

## 4.7 Integrations

* **SCM/CI:** GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket; commit SHAs, PR checks, signed tags.
* **Experiment & Model Stores:** MLflow, Weights & Biases, SageMaker/Vertex/Databricks, Hugging Face.
* **Orchestrators:** Argo/K8s, Airflow, Prefect.
* **Secret Mgmt:** Vault/KMS/Cloud KMS.
* **Issue & ITSM:** Jira/ServiceNow for approvals/exceptions.
* **Identity & RBAC:** SSO (OIDC/SAML), fine-grained roles, group sync.
* **SIEM/SOAR:** ship logs/events; alert on policy violations.

## 4.8 Access & Roles

* **Roles:** Viewer, Contributor, Model Owner, Approver (MRC), Security, Legal, SRE, Admin.
* **SoD:** Approver cannot be artifact author; production promotion requires 2-person rule for High risk.
* **Scopes:** per model, per environment, per action; API tokens tied to service accounts.

## 4.9 Audit & Evidence

* **Immutable Log:** append-only with cryptographic hash chain; WORM storage option.
* **Evidence Bundles:** export ZIP of metadata, evals, approvals, SBOM, scans, deployment diffs.
* **Reports:** Model Inventory, High-Risk Models, Upcoming Recerts, Violations, Drift Outliers, License Exposure.

---

# 5) Non-Functional Requirements

* **Availability:** 99.9% service; read-only mode on maintenance.
* **Performance:** search < 500 ms p95; publish with 1GB artifacts < 2 min (excluding storage latency).
* **Scalability:** ≥10k models, ≥100k versions, ≥1M artifacts; horizontal scaling.
* **Security:** TLS everywhere, artifact & metadata encryption at rest, signed artifacts/images, OPA-enforced authorization, least-privileged service accounts.
* **Compliance:** audit logs retained ≥7 years (configurable); GDPR DSAR support for logs containing personal data.
* **Data Residency:** region-pin artifacts and logs; policy prevents cross-region deploys when restricted.
* **Backups/DR:** RPO ≤ 1h, RTO ≤ 4h; quarterly recovery test.
* **Cost Controls:** lifecycle policies (cold storage after N days), per-team quotas.

* **Signing:** sign artifacts and container at build; verify at promote/deploy.
* **Environment Promotion:** staging shadow → canary → full; auto-rollback on SLO breach.
* **Notifications:** Slack/Email/Teams on gate results, approvals needed, drift/violations.

---

# 12) Reporting & Dashboards

* **Inventory & Risk Heatmap:** models by tier, business criticality, region.
* **Compliance:** upcoming recerts, exceptions expiring, policy violations.
* **Quality:** eval trends, safety incidents, jailbreak attempts blocked.
* **Operations:** latency/throughput/SLOs per deployment, rollbacks and causes.
* **Supply Chain:** unsigned artifacts, missing SBOMs, vulnerable deps.

---

# 13) RACI (sample)

* **Register Model:** Owner (R), Security (C), MRC (C), Admin (I)
* **Approve Risk:** MRC (A/R), Security (C), Owner (R), Legal (C)
* **Promote to Prod:** Owner (R), SRE (R), Security (A), MRC (A), Product (A for high-risk business impact)
* **Policy Management:** Security (A/R), Admin (R), Legal (C)
* **Audit Response:** Security (A/R), Owner (R), MRC (R), Admin (I)

---

# 14) Migration & Interop

* Import adapters for **MLflow Models**, **Hugging Face repos**, **SageMaker/Vertex registries**.
* Bulk metadata backfill tool; hash reconcile artifacts; policy “grandfather with expiry” for legacy models.

---

# 15) Phased Delivery Plan

**MVP (8–12 weeks)**

* Registry (models/versions/artifacts), minimal metadata, search.
* Policy engine (license + completeness), approvals, Model Cards.
* CI integration, SBOM ingestion, basic eval hook + thresholds.
* SSO/RBAC, audit log, evidence export.

**Phase 2**

* Full eval registry, bias/safety/red-team suites, dashboards.
* Drift detection & guardrails; canary/shadow deploy wiring.
* Exceptions lifecycle & time-boxed controls.

**Phase 3**

* Multi-region residency controls, WORM storage option.
* Advanced explainability bundles, automated recertification.
* Marketplace-style discovery and usage analytics.

---

# 16) Acceptance Criteria (samples)

* Cannot promote to **prod** without: complete metadata, SBOM, license scan=pass, evals≥thresholds, MRC+Security approvals recorded.
* All artifact downloads are hash-verified; unsigned images are blocked in prod.
* Drift > threshold auto-creates recertification task and can reduce traffic split.
* Evidence export reconstructs a prod promotion (hash-consistent) end-to-end.

---

# 17) Security Controls (highlights)

* **Secrets:** never stored in metadata; references only (Vault paths).
* **PII Protections:** automatic redaction in logs; evals must include PII leakage tests for LLMs.
* **Key Mgmt:** per-env KMS keys; artifact encryption and signature verification mandatory in prod.
* **Network:** private endpoints/VPC peering; egress controls for model training data paths.

---

* Generate a **YAML policy pack** seed (license, eval thresholds, risk gates),
* Provide **OpenAPI** stubs for all endpoints,
* Draft **Jira epics/stories** for the MVP,

* Modern Web Frontend
* Microservice based backend
* Run in Kubernetes
* use Amazon Aurora datbase as database
* Setup repo with .gitignore
* create detailed documentation
* create detailed developer documentation
* Structure the repo to have both the front end and back end in the same repo
