## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in the AI Model Registry, please report it to us privately.

### How to Report

1. **Email**: Send details to security@yourcompany.com
2. **Subject**: Include "AI Model Registry Security Vulnerability" in the subject line
3. **Details**: Provide as much information as possible, including:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 72 hours
- **Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 7 days

### Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:
- Give us reasonable time to fix the issue before public disclosure
- Do not access or modify data that doesn't belong to you
- Do not perform actions that could harm our systems or users

## Security Measures

### Code Security

- **Static Analysis**: All code is scanned with Semgrep and ESLint security rules
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scans with npm audit and Snyk
- **Container Scanning**: Docker images scanned with Trivy
- **Secret Detection**: TruffleHog and custom rules prevent secret commits

### Infrastructure Security

- **Encryption**: All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication required
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Network Security**: VPC isolation and security groups
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and alerting

### Development Security

- **Secure Coding**: Security guidelines and training for developers
- **Code Review**: All changes require security-focused code review
- **Testing**: Security tests included in CI/CD pipeline
- **Dependencies**: Regular updates and vulnerability assessments

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets** - Use environment variables and secret management
2. **Validate all inputs** - Sanitize and validate user inputs
3. **Use secure defaults** - Follow principle of least privilege
4. **Keep dependencies updated** - Regular security updates
5. **Follow OWASP guidelines** - Implement OWASP Top 10 protections

### For Operators

1. **Regular updates** - Keep systems and dependencies current
2. **Monitor logs** - Watch for suspicious activities
3. **Backup data** - Regular, tested backups
4. **Network security** - Proper firewall and network segmentation
5. **Access control** - Regular access reviews and cleanup

## Security Tools and Scanning

### Automated Scanning

The following security tools are integrated into our CI/CD pipeline:

- **Semgrep**: Static analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **ESLint Security**: JavaScript/TypeScript security linting
- **npm audit**: Node.js dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Snyk**: Comprehensive vulnerability database scanning
- **Trivy**: Container image vulnerability scanning
- **TruffleHog**: Secret detection in code and commits
- **CodeQL**: GitHub's semantic code analysis

### Manual Security Testing

- **Penetration Testing**: Regular third-party security assessments
- **Code Review**: Security-focused manual code reviews
- **Architecture Review**: Security architecture assessments

## Compliance and Standards

The AI Model Registry is designed to meet:

- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security, availability, and confidentiality
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk management
- **OWASP ASVS**: Application security verification

## Security Updates

Security updates and advisories are published:

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: For vulnerability disclosures
- **Release Notes**: Security fixes included in release notes
- **Security Blog**: Detailed security updates and best practices

## Bug Bounty Program

We operate a responsible disclosure program. Researchers who discover and report security vulnerabilities may be eligible for recognition and rewards based on:

- **Severity**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Impact**: Potential damage and scope
- **Quality**: Clarity and completeness of report
- **Cooperation**: Following responsible disclosure guidelines
