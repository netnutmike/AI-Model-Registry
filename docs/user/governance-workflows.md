## Governance Overview

### What is Model Governance?

Model governance ensures that AI models are:
- **Compliant** with organizational policies and regulations
- **Secure** and protected against threats
- **Ethical** and fair in their operation
- **Traceable** with complete audit trails
- **Reliable** and meeting quality standards

### Governance Principles

1. **Risk-Based Approach**: Higher risk models require more stringent controls
2. **Separation of Duties**: Different roles for development, review, and deployment
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing oversight throughout model lifecycle
4. **Transparency**: Clear documentation and audit trails
5. **Accountability**: Clear ownership and responsibility
