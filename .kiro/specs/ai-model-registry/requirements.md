# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Model Registry is a comprehensive platform that serves as a single source of truth for AI models (classical ML and LLMs/agents) with built-in governance, risk management, and compliance controls. The system provides a modern web frontend and microservice-based backend architecture, designed to manage the complete lifecycle of AI models from registration through deployment and monitoring, with embedded governance controls for audit compliance and risk management.
